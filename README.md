# WinVirshViewer
A [Net6-Windows](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) program to manage vm’s on a Linux host from an Windows system over ssh/virsh commands. Its by far not a full replacement of [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/), but its enough to start/suspend vm’s and manage snapshots.
